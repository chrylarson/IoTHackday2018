By: Chris Larson & Isaiah Mack

Mobile Nurse is designed to assistant medical practitioners in clinical, surgical, and outpatient scenarios. At the foundation, Mobile Nurse will utilize the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to help a user navigate hospital floor plans. The long-term goal is to create a system that is capable of supporting practitionerâ€™s decision-making efforts through the utilization of data analytics, facilitated communication between practitioner, patients, and medical devices, and adaptive data security techniques.
